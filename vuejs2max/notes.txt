Vue CLI
-------

npm install -g vue-cli

available templates
    simple 
    webpack-simple 
    webpack 
    browserify
    browserify-simple
    
to create a new project with the vue-cli, get in the directory
where you want the new project directory created
type

	vue init [template-name] [project name]
	
so, if we want to create a project named vue-cli in the
current directory using the webpack-simple template, we 
would type
	vue init webpack-simple vue-cli
	
then cd to the directory that was just created (vue-cli)
and run npm install

when that finishes, still in the same directory run
	npm run dev
	
that will start a development server that watches the files 
and updates automatically
